## What is Nyaku?
Nyaku is a framework written in PHP that allows for Discord server owners to better moderate their server.

## What does it do?
Nyaku can use Webhooks and Bots to access different parts of a Discord server. Webhooks are primarily used for messages while Bots can be used to automate a variety of things. While Discord already has a lot of libraries for bot development, Nyaku makes it easier by providing an interactive task-based system that responds to certain stimulations.

## Usage
To use Nyaku, make sure you download the version that best suits your needs.

### If you need to constantly use different webhooks:
Use 'nyaku_webenter'
### If you have a static list of webhooks:
Use 'nyaku_webembed'

###### Warning: Nyaku is in beta. Over time, it will be able to do more. It can only handle sending simple webhook requests at the moment.
